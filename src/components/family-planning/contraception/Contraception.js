They contain a progestogen-only hormone which helps thicken cervical mucous and blocks the sperm and egg from meeting and prevents ovulation. They are effective in preventing pregnancy in over 99% of cases but do not protect against sexually transmitted infections or HIV. For this you need to use condoms. Hormonal implants need to be inserted by a trained professional and can be used for 3-5 years depending on the brand. A small percentage of women will experience irregular bleeding but many will stop having periods altogether. â€¢	Once the implant is removed or expires, you can get pregnant immediately.'},
