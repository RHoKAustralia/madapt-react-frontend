        <h1>Birth Spacing and Family Planning Overview</h1>
        <p>Women have the right to choose when and if they want to have children and also, how many children they wish to have.

Spacing children apart is beneficial for both mother and babyâ€™s physical and psychosocial health and wellbeing. 
Knowing whether you do or don't want to have children (or more children) in the next few years can help you and your partner prepare for conception or choose appropriate contraception. 
The timing of your pregnancies is important 
Closely spaced pregnancies might not give a mother enough time to recover from pregnancy before moving on to the next. For example, pregnancy and breast-feeding can deplete your stores of nutrients, particularly folate and iron. 

If you become pregnant before replacing those stores, it could affect your health or your baby's health.
Inflammation of the genital tract that develops during pregnancy and doesn't completely heal before the next pregnancy could also play a role.
Research suggests that beginning a pregnancy within six months of a live birth is associated with an increased risk of certain physical and mental health disorders.
