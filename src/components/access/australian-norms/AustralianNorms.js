      <p>Family doctors in Australia are also called General Practitioner (GP).

Some doctors work in health centres and hospitals and some work in their own offices.

You can make your own appointment with the doctor when you are sick or feeling unwell.

You can see a doctor even if you feel healthy but want a health check-up to make sure you don’t have any health problems.

A doctor can also tell you if you need vaccination or immunisation to protect you from some illness.

You can choose a male or a female doctor.

You can choose to change your doctor at any time.

If you want to go to a different doctor, you should give your new doctor a list of medicines you are taking and a copy of your medical records.

If you are unwell and you need a doctor at night, on weekends and public holidays you can use one of these free medical services
