      <p>Pregnancy can be both an exciting and stressful time for women and their families.</p>
      <p>Understanding what to expect helps reduce anxiety and fear surrounding childbirth and motherhood.</p>
      <p>It is also essential to monitor potential risk factors as this can alert both mother and health care work to take action should these risks present</p>
      <p>Ideally, antenatal care should be provided by a small group of healthcare professionals with whom the woman feels comfortable.</p>
      <p>A system of clear referral paths should be established so that pregnant women who require additional care are managed and treated by the appropriate specialist teams when problems are identified.</p>
